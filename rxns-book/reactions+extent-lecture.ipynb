The atoms may leave the reactor in a different molecular configuration due to the reaction, but the total mass leaving the reactor must be the same.\n\n-   We consider the water gas shift reaction:\n\n$CO + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_2 + CO_2$.\n\n-   The total mass at any time will be $M_{CO} + M_{H_2O} + M_{H_2} + M_{CO_2}$.\n    -   These are related to the number of moles of each species through the species molecular weights.\n\n-   Let $\\vec{N}$ be a vector that is the number of moles of each species. Then, the total mass is: $\\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{MW}$.\n\n-   Stoichiometry constrains the relationship between the moles of each species during reaction.\n\n-   Suppose we start with this initial number of moles of each species: $[N_0, N_0, 0, 0]$.\n    -   Now, if $n$ moles of A\\_1 reacts, we know that $n$ moles of A\\_2 react, and $n$ moles of A\\_3 and A\\_4 are produced.\n    -   In otherwords, the new number of moles of each species is: $\\vec{N_0} + n\\vec{\\alpha}$. And the new mass is correspondingly: $(\\vec{N_0} + n\\vec{\\alpha}) \\cdot \\vec{MW}$ or: $M_0 + n\\vec{\\alpha}\\cdot\\vec{MW}$.\n\n-   In a properly balanced chemical reaction, there are the same number of each type of atom on each side of the reaction, so the sum of molecular weights of reactants must be the same as products, and $\\vec{\\alpha}\\vec{MW}=0$. Therefore, the total mass does not change for any $n$!\n\n-   We can illustrate the conservation of mass with the following equation: $\\vec{\\alpha}\\vec{MW}=0$. Where $\\vec{\\alpha}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient vector and $\\vec{MW}$ is a column vector of molecular weights.\n\n-   For simplicity, we use pure isotope molecular weights, and not the isotope-weighted molecular weights. This equation simply examines the mass on the right side of the equation and the mass on left side of the equation.\n\n[numpy.array](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html)\n[numpy.dot](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)\n[range](https://www.google.com/#safe=off&q=range)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"[0, 1, 2, 3]"}],"source":["print(list(range(4)))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"1.  0\n2.  0\n3.  0\n4.  0\n5.  0\n6.  0\n[-28 -18   2  44]"}],"source":["import numpy as np\nimport pycse.orgmode as org\n\n# stoichiometric vector for\n# CO + H2O -> H2 + CO2\nalpha = np.array([-1, -1, 1, 1])\n\nMW = np.array([28, 18, 2, 44])     # Molecular weights gm/mol\n\nprint('1.
